# The Farm Problem

In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

- `chickens` = 2 legs
- `cows` = 4 legs
- `pigs` = 4 legs

The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the **total number of legs** of all the animals.

### Examples
animals(chickens, cows, pigs)|Expected
-|-
`animals(2, 3, 5)`|&#10132;&#160;`36`
`animals(1, 2, 3)`|&#10132;&#160;`22`
`animals(5, 2, 8)`|&#10132;&#160;`50`

### Notes
- Don't forget to `return` the result.
- The order of animals passed is `animals(chickens, cows, pigs)`.
- Remember that the farmer wants to know the **total number of legs** and not the total number of animals.

# Return Something to Me!

Write a function that returns the string `"something"` joined with a space `" "` and the given argument `a`.

`giveMeSomething("Bob Jane")`|&#10132;&#160;`"something Bob Jane"`
`giveMeSomething("something")`|&#10132;&#160;`"something something"`

### Notes
- Assume an input is given.
